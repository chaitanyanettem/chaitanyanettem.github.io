<p>Hi! My name is <span tooltip="Pronounced: Chai-tuh-nya">Chaitanya</span> Nettem. I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer at <a href="https://rubrik.com" target="_blank">Rubrik</a>. I help build complex distributed systems for data protection and storage. For the last 3 years I have been one of the tech leads for Atlas, Rubrik&rsquo;s distributed filesystem. Atlas is deployed on thousands of clusters across the world both on-premises and in the cloud with total data under management at exabyte scale.</p>

<p>In the past I was a founding engineer and lead at <a href="https://getmason.io" target="_blank">Mason</a> (formerly called Kubric) where I built products that made content creation and collaboration at scale easy for designers and creative teams. I spoke about some of this work at <a href="https://youtu.be/rvEa25RDWwo?t=567" target="_blank">Demuxed 2019</a>. I was responsible for all of our ML/AI features (read more about some of that work <a href="https://reads.kubric.io/blog/eliminate-the-grunt-work-automation-tech-at-kubric/" target="_blank">here</a>), building our rendering pipeline, search, autosuggest, data ingestion, publishing etc.</p>

<p>Most of my recent work has been with C++, Go and Python.</p>
