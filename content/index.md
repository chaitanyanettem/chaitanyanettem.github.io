Hi! My name is Chaitanya Nettem. I'm a Software Engineer at [Rubrik](https://rubrik.com). I help build complex distributed systems for data protection and storage. For the last 3 years I have been a tech lead on Rubrik's distributed filesystem team.

In the past I was a founding engineer and lead at [Mason](https://getmason.io) where I built software for making content creation and collaboration at scale easy for designers and creative teams.

Most of my recent work has been with C++, Go and Python.
