Hi! My name is [Chaitanya]{tooltip="Pronounced: Chai-tuh-nya"} Nettem. I'm a Software Engineer at [Rubrik](https://rubrik.com). I help build complex distributed systems for data protection and storage. For the last 3 years I have been one of the tech leads for Atlas, Rubrik's distributed filesystem. Atlas is deployed on thousands of clusters across the world both on-premises and in the cloud with total data under management at exabyte scale.

In the past I was a founding engineer and lead at [Mason](https://getmason.io) (formerly called Kubric) where I built products that made content creation and collaboration at scale easy for designers and creative teams. I spoke about some of this work at [Demuxed 2019](https://youtu.be/rvEa25RDWwo?t=567). I was responsible for all of our ML/AI features (read more about some of that work [here](https://reads.kubric.io/blog/eliminate-the-grunt-work-automation-tech-at-kubric/)), building our rendering pipeline, search, autosuggest, data ingestion, publishing etc.

Most of my recent work has been with C++, Go and Python.

### SOME PAST OPEN SOURCE WORK -
- [Search for Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20230302185343/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chaitanya.im.searchforreddit): Check for reposts/find past Reddit threads and search Reddit for anything. Organically got 10k+ installs before I stopped maintaining it. Find the code [here](https://github.com/chaitanyanettem/searchforreddit).
- [Book price comparison engine - JustCompare](https://github.com/chaitanyanettem/justcompare): JustCompare was a search engine for book prices in Indian retail sites I built as an undergrad project. This involved scraping a lot of data using Python and the full-text search capabilities of Postgres.
